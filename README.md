## How was the code written?

there is three folders `node_modules`, `public` and `src`

#### Public

In public folder there is `public/index.html` file contain all we need with html and `favicon.ico`

#### src

**`src`** folder containes assets, components, css, `index.js`.
After setup my environment in my machine with `create-react-app`, I made a directory in src folder for images called `src/Assets` in this directory put all images, PDFs, etc...
**`src/Components`** contains all components and thier styles
**`src/Components/css`** All css components files being here
**`src/Components/main`** my website contains 6 sections and Navigation bar with 7 main components, and that is being in main folder
**Note**: The components in `src/Components` folder are partials components that need it in main components
**`src/App.js`** that is the main component that contains all main comoponents in`src/Components/main` folder
**`src/index.js`** this file rendering the my `App.js` component that contain main components after `npm start command`
**`src/index.css`** contains general css styles
